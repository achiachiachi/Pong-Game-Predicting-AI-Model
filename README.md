# Pong-Game-Predicting-AI-Model:
A simple pong game, made in python turtle, that is built on scikit-learn Random Forest Regressor. It has tracked 100000 pieces of data and based on that makes predictions on where the bar should go.

# HOW TO USE:
If you would like to run it directly, just run the 'trained.py' file, but make sure all the relevant libraries are present and also 'model.pkl' file.

# HOT TO TRAIN IT YOURSELF:
Attached you will find 'main.py', 'data.csv', 'PongTrainer.ipynb' and 'trained.py'. If you would like to train the model yourself, run 'main.py' at first. Here the game will play itself at super speeds, collecting data into a 'data.csv' file. Afterwards, put this 'data.csv' file into 'PongTrainer.ipynb' jupyter notebook and run it. This will save a 'model.pkl' file onto the Jupyter notebook. Save it, put it in a folder next to 'trained.py' and run the program.
